Notes on Tote Monitor:
Last update Dec 20, 2018

Mounting the HC-SR04 ultrasonic rangefinder:

Idea #1, inside the tank:
My first thought was to mount the device inside the tank, and then considered
gluing it to the bottom of the screw cap. The back of the board has components
that might not be compatible with glue. Perhaps attaching it to another
board would work? The mount holes are very small, so screws are probably not
an option. Maybe soldering a fat wire in each corner to attach the boards to
each other? Then there is the glue itself. The cap is plastic #2, HDPE. It
looks like a highly special solvent/glue is needed for this. This is not
looking like a good solution.

Idea #2, on top of the tank:
The tank must be ventilated, so drilling holes is an option. So if the device
can be placed on top of the tank, two holes could be drilled for the TX and RX
transducers. Glue is probably not needed if the transducers have a good tight
fit in the holes. Further, no wiring will need to go through the tank or cap.

Transducer diameter: 0.625 nominal
Center to center distance: 1.00 inches

Plan: Scribe two drill points 1.00 apart, drill tiny starter holes.
Then drill final holes with 5/8 bit.
Check fit, if too loose, use shims. If too tight, cut one side slightly.

Choosing location:
The claimed beam width is 15 degrees. At 48 inches, that gives a diameter
of about 12 inches. The tote sides will probably not reflect, so this may
not be as important is it first appears. But closer to the center is probably
better. Tentatively, the water in and out pipes will be in the rear two
corners, so anywhere near the center is fine.

CALIBRATING THE DISTANCES AND TANK FULL PERCENTAGE:

The tank is nearly full at the 1000 liter (264 gallon) mark. I will label
this the 100% point. Starting with an empty tank, I will use the microsecond
count on the LCD to find the values for every 100 liters. Then I will build
a table of these values and a function to interpolate 0 to 99 gallons between
any two points. To allow for human error when filling, I will find out how
much more than 1000 liters the tank can safely handle.

OPEN QUESTIONS:

A beeper is probably necessary to avoid overflow from human error. Should it
beep once at 100, 200, .. 900 liters? Should it beep at some rate during the
last 100 liters? What would be a good alarm beep when it reaches 100%?

CALIBRATION DATA:

Round trip times were taken for empty and every 100 liters from 200 to 1000.
The first number is the sum of five samples.

empty:	29800	5960
100:	26900	5380	(interpolated)
200:	24000	4800
300:	21200	4240
400:	18670	3734
500:	16000	3200
600:	13420	2684
700:	10750	2150
800:	8060	1612
900:	5342	1068
1000:	2680	 536
1100:	  20	   4	(calculated)

These numbers go into a table at the bottom of the source code.

WIRING:

The microcontroller and display will be in the house, where the valves
and other plumbing are. The sonar unit will be in the garage, on the tank.

There are two twisted pairs available, the orange pair and the green pair.
I will use solid orange and solid green for the 5 volt and ground.
Orange/white will be trigger and green/white will be echo. The total
length will probably be 150 to 200 feet.

PLUMBING:

There are two pipes going to the tank, one to serve the house, the other for
refilling. The refill pipe is trivial, it connects to a hose going into the
tank cap. There will be no real pressure at this end.

A 1/2 inch CPVC pipe goes through a hole drilled in the top of the tank.
At the top, it has a threaded fitting that connects to an iron tee. Two
nylon adapters connect the tee to two vinyl hoses. These hoses go to two
water pumps (probably made for an RV water system.) The output of the
pumps go back together at another iron tee. From there, the water goes to 
a garden faucet adapter, then an RV water hose, and then to the main
pipe that goes to the house.

The water pumps have pressure switches, and turn on and off automatically
as needed for house water demand. They run off 12 volts, from a power supply.
