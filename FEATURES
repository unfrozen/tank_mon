The "Tank Monitor" is a system to display the amount of water in a tank, and
to give useful information on water usage.  This is designed for an
International Bulk Container ("tote"), but other water tanks can use this
if there is a way to mount the ultrasonic sender on the inside, pointed down.

All parts of this system are very inexpensive and easily bought on eBay.
CPU module: $1.03, Display: $1.88, Range Finder: $1.25, Wires: $0.25
You will also need a 5-volt power supply. A cheap micro-USB cell phone
charger is probably fine. The CPU programmer is $2.50

If you would like to monitor and record the water level with a computer,
you can get a TTL to USB converter for $1.00 to $1.50 With this, you can
use a terminal program and save the information every second and use it
as historical data.

The ultrasonic range finder is "HC-SR04" and is probably usable to a
distance of 10 to 12 feet.

DISPLAY MODES:

The display can show what you are interested in viewing. Change the mode
by pressing one of the mode buttons under the display.

Example displays:
1. "L  250.5"  Water level in Gallons
2. "L 1000 L"  Water level in Liters
3. "L 100 PC"  Water level in Percentage of full
4. "P  12345"  Water level Ping time (for calibration)
